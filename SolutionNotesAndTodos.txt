Solution Notes and Todos
- Implement error handling for file operations
- Add unit tests for each helper function
- Update documentation with usage examples
- Consider performance optimizations for bulk inserts

Considerations:
- I tried to test set up the solution for testing the published Nuget packagaes but the code became unnecessarily complex.
I will start up a new solution to test the Nuget packages . MapPiloteGeopackageHelperExamples
- I think there is a mixup of tests and examples of using the Nuget packages. This can be cleaned up by creating a new solution.
	- Simpler examples of usage can be added to the README.md files in the Nuget packages.
- I have not yet tested the Nuget packages in a real project. This is a future task.
